## 🔄 Program Flow

1. Page load initializes the game state and renders the board.
2. The player starts a new session and enters a valid username.
3. A countdown sequence (3-2-1-GO) begins, followed by a short card preview.
4. The gameplay loop starts and card interactions are enabled.
5. Each card selection triggers match validation.
6. A successful match updates progress and advances the round.
7. A mismatch increments wrong tries and flips the cards back after a short delay.
8. The player can pause and resume the round at any time.
9. The countdown timer runs continuously until the round ends.
10. The session ends when all pairs are matched or the time expires.
11. A result screen is displayed with statistics and animated feedback.

## 🧱 OOP Standards

- **Encapsulation:** Game logic and state are isolated within classes such as `Game`, `Board`, `Timer`, `AudioManager`, and `UIManager`, with controlled access through private fields and methods.
- **Abstraction:** Interfaces such as `IGame`, `IBoard`, `ICard`, `ITimer`, `IAudioManager`, and `IUIManager` define clear contracts and separate implementation details from usage.
- **Polymorphism:** Interface-based polymorphism allows interchangeable implementations without breaking expected behavior.
- **Composition over Inheritance:** The `Game` class composes multiple modules (`Board`, `Timer`, `UI`, and `Audio`) to build flexible and scalable behavior.

---

## 🧩 SOLID Principles

- **S - Single Responsibility:** Each class has a focused role; for example, `Timer` handles time tracking while `Board` manages card generation and shuffling.
- **O - Open/Closed:** The architecture is extendable with new cards, sounds, and UI behavior, although a few hardcoded values can still be externalized.
- **L - Liskov Substitution:** Implementations respect their interface contracts and can be used without unexpected behavior.
- **I - Interface Segregation:** Interfaces are domain-specific; larger contracts like `UIManager` can be split further if the app grows.
- **D - Dependency Inversion:** The code already relies on abstractions in type definitions, and constructor-based dependency injection would improve flexibility further.

## 🌍 Best Practices & Standards

### 🔍 SEO

- Descriptive page titles and meta descriptions
- Canonical URLs to avoid duplicate content
- Structured data for better search engine understanding
- Sitemap and robots.txt for crawl optimization

### ♿ Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA roles for assistive technologies
- Accessible UI controls such as audio toggle, modals, and overlays
- Clear navigation and readable content

### ⚡ Performance

- Optimized asset loading and a lightweight static structure
- Reduced DOM thrashing by building card markup with `DocumentFragment` before a single append
- Used event delegation for board interactions instead of attaching listeners to every card
- Cached frequently used DOM references to avoid repeated queries
- Updated only the necessary text, class, and style values to avoid full UI re-renders.
- Avoided unnecessary blocking scripts and kept execution modular
- Used native DOM APIs for efficient, minimal updates
- Preconnected to external resources where appropriate to reduce connection overhead

### 🔐 Security

- Safe external linking with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- No unsafe user input injection
- Controlled DOM manipulation
- No exposure of sensitive data

### 🛠️ Maintainability

- Modular architecture across core logic, UI, services, and models
- Clear separation of concerns
- Centralized metadata and configuration
- Scalable folder structure

### 🌐 Cross-Compatibility

- TypeScript is used as the JavaScript preprocessor to produce browser-ready ES module output.
- Sass is used as the CSS preprocessor to keep styles modular and consistent across browsers.
- The app relies on standard HTML, CSS, and native DOM APIs to remain compatible with modern browsers.
- Static assets and compiled output are separated from source files to simplify deployment across environments.
- A lightweight structure helps the app run reliably on GitHub Pages, local static servers, and other hosting platforms.

### 🌐 Web Quality / Discoverability

- Custom 404 page with `noindex` to avoid low-value indexing
- Sitemap for clear URL structure
- Robots.txt to control crawler behavior
- Social metadata for better sharing previews
